Amplicon Annotation and Repeat Masking contains:


find_unique_regions.py: Takes FASTA file of a genome or chromosome as input and finds how many times each region maps to the whole genome.

This script works by generating all possible reads of a given size from a reference genome 
or chromosome by moving a window of that size one base at a time over each chromosome.
Those reads are then mapped to the entire reference genome using bowtie2.

NOTE: This script takes a very long time to run.


make_rep_graph.py: Takes sam file created by find_unique_regions.py and makes a bedGraph file of regions of the Y chromosome and how many times they map in the human genome.


make_goodbases_set.py: Takes bedGraph file of Y-chromosome mapability created by make_rep_graph.py and creates a python pickle file of the set of bases that map as many times as expected.


Y_repeats.txt: plantext version of Table S3 in Teitz et al. 2018 used in the make_goodbases_set.py script.


good_chrY_amplicon_bases_w100_c11.pickle: File generated by make_goodbases_set.py; set of amplicon and control region bases that map the expected number of times, using a window size of 100 and a bowtie2 alignment score cutof of -11. This file is used in various scripts in CNV Detection.
